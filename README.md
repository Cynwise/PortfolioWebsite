# PortfolioWebsite

Website Story

  I went ahead and put together a simple portfolio website that I can use for my personal and professional web development work. I'd like to 
  make the site more responsive with dedicated mobile viewport elements and i'd like to incorporate javascript into soon. One big challenge
  and something i've learned from developing this website is how to overlay text onto images and how make the page elements reactive to changes
  in the users' viewport size.
